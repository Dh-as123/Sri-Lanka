        <p>Sri Lanka: A Jewel in the Indian Ocean
        Sri Lanka, officially known as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is a beautiful island nation located in the Indian Ocean, just off the southeastern coast of India. Often referred to as the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean," Sri Lanka is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and unique biodiversity.</p>

<p>Geography and Climate
Sri Lanka covers an area of around 65,610 square kilometers. It boasts a variety of geographical features, including pristine beaches, lush rainforests, rolling hills, and fertile plains. The central highlands are home to famous tea plantations and misty mountains. The country has a tropical climate with two main monsoon seasons: the southwest monsoon (May to September) and the northeast monsoon (December to February).</p>

<p>History and Culture
Sri Lanka has a recorded history that spans over 2,500 years. It was home to ancient civilizations such as the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa kingdoms. Buddhism was introduced to the island in the 3rd century BCE, and it continues to play a significant role in the country’s cultural and religious life. The island was colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, then the Dutch, and finally the British, who ruled until Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948.</p>

<p>The country has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist, form the majority, while Tamils (mostly Hindus), Muslims, and Christians make up significant minorities. This diversity is reflected in Sri Lanka’s festivals, languages (Sinhala and Tamil are official languages), and cuisine.</p>

<p>Economy
Sri Lanka’s economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Tea, rubber, and coconut are traditional exports, with Ceylon tea being especially famous worldwide. Tourism is a growing industry due to the country's natural beauty and cultural sites, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as Sigiriya, the ancient city of Anuradhapura, and the sacred city of Kandy.</p>
In recent decades, Sri Lanka has undergone economic modernization, but it has also faced challenges including political instability, a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009, and most recently, a severe economic crisis in 2022 marked by inflation, fuel shortages, and debt default.</p>

<p>Wildlife and Nature
Sri Lanka is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. Despite its small size, it is home to elephants, leopards, sloth bears, and over 400 species of birds. Yala, Udawalawe, and Wilpattu are among the major national parks that attract wildlife enthusiasts from around the globe. The surrounding seas are also rich in marine life, including blue whales and coral reefs.</p>

<p>Modern Sri Lanka
Today, Sri Lanka is a republic with a parliamentary system. The country continues to recover from its recent economic troubles while striving for political and social stability. Its people are known for their hospitality, and its culture remains vibrant and resilient.</p>

<p>From ancient temples and colonial architecture to surf beaches and spice gardens, Sri Lanka offers a unique blend of history, nature, and charm that captivates visitors and locals alike.</p>
